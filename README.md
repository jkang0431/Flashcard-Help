# Flashcard-Help
Okay, so before we get into the code, I suppose I should give you a rundown of what Anki is and how it functions. Anki is a memorization program that utilizes flashcards in order for you to maintain long-term memories of what you choose to create, allowing for better retention and more efficient studying. It achieves this through two main overarching phenomena/concepts: active recall and spaced repetition (you can totally skip this part if you know what these are). Active recall is the act of retrieving information solely from memory, a.k.a. "practice testing". This strengthens the memory itself by forcing you to conjure up the answer through your own ability. This is in contrast to passive recall, with methods such as rereading notes and highlights, which essentially cheat you into thinking that you're actually remembering the material, even though you’re really not. Then there’s spaced repetition, which is based around the concept of the forgetting curve (image below), which states that we forget something after a certain period of time, but as long as we continually interrupt our brain from forgetting it, the amount of time it takes for us to forget increases.

Anki combines these two concepts by dishing out flashcards at specific intervals (usually right before it hits your forgetting point in the forgetting curve so that the effort spent remembering is greater) through its algorithm based on how you answered the flashcard the previous time. 

**Flashcard Structures**

Flashcards have formats, known as note types, that determine what sort of function they have. Note types have fields that allow users to designate what type of info they want to put into them. Think of them as Legos that allow for clean separation and organization that then culminate into the final product. Anki gives a few standard note types for users that are perfectly fine, but users can create their own note types. For example, Anki's *Basic* note type has two fields: Front and Back. As their names suggest, the Front field shows what a user wants to see when testing the flashcard, and then when prompted, the Back field will reveal the answer or whatever else the user wants to see. For the current Korean flashcards that I'm asking for your help on, the note type has six fields (as shown below).

On the front, I'm shown a Korean word along with a native pronunciation. When I think I have the correct answer, I flip to the back side, where I'm shown the English translation of the word, example sentences with that word included, an image of what that word is, and an image of that word being used in context.
